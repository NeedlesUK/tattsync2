      <h1>Your Tattoo Aftercare Guide</h1>
      <p>Thank you for your trust in getting tattooed by <strong>{{artistName}}</strong> at our event. Here's everything you need to know to keep your tattoo healing beautifully:</p>
      
      <h2>1. How Long To Leave Wrapped?</h2>
      <p>There are numerous different coverings in use in the tattoo industry. Your artist will give you specific instructions.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Cleaning Your Tattoo</h2>
      <p>Clean your tattoo every day with a clean hand, warm water, and a fragrance-free soap. Let it air dry or gently pat it dry with a clean towel. Showers are great but no sitting water.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Aftercare Products</h2>
      <p>Apply a thin layer of recommended aftercare cream using a clean hand 3-4 times a day.</p>
      
      <h2>4. When To Cover Tattoo</h2>
      <p>Cover your new tattoo when in a dirty environment to help avoid infection. Allow skin to breathe as much as possible.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Clean Clothes And Bedding</h2>
      <p>Always use a clean towel whilst your tattoo is healing and allow it to air dry when possible. Keep clothes and bedding clean and fresh!</p>
      
      <h2>6. Avoid Standing Water</h2>
      <p>Avoid soaking your tattoo for at least a week i.e. baths, swimming, dishwater. Running water such as showers are perfect.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Avoid UV Rays</h2>
      <p>Avoid direct sunlight & sun beds for at least 2 weeks. Always use a strong sunblock to keep your tattoo at its best.</p>
      
      <h2>8. Do Not Pick Or Scratch</h2>
      <p>Please do not pick or scratch your tattoo whilst it is healing. This can cause trauma to the skin and lead to scarring and infection.</p>
      
      <h2>9. Concerns or questions?</h2>
      <p>The artist that applied your tattoo is responsible for any touch-ups, concerns, or ongoing advice.</p>
